# Road-Accident-Analysis-Dashboard
A guided EXCEL project analyzing Road Accident data

##  Project Overview  
This project presents an interactive Road Accident Analysis Dashboard created in MS Excel to analyze and visualize accident data across multiple dimensions, such as vehicle type, road conditions, light conditions , and accident location. 
It identifies key insights, and uncovers patterns that could help improve safety and awareness.


## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

### ðŸ”¹ Primary KPIs
1. Total Casualties Taken After the Accident
   Displays the overall number of casualties recorded 
   
2. Total Casualties and Percentage by Severity 
   Shows the distribution of casualties based on severity (Fatal, Serious, Slight) and their percentage of the overall total.  

3. Maximum Casualties by Type of Vehicle  
   Identifies which vehicle category (Car, Bike, Bus, Van, etc.) was involved in the highest number of casualties.  


### ðŸ”¸ Secondary KPIs
1. **Total Casualties by Vehicle Type**  
   Breaks down the total number of casualties across different vehicle categories.  

2. **Monthly Trend (Current vs Previous Year)** 
   Compares the number of casualties recorded monthly against the previous year to reveal seasonal trends.  

3.**Maximum Casualties by Road Type** 
   Highlights which road type (Single Carriageway, Dual Carriageway, Roundabout, etc.) has the highest recorded casualties.  

4.**Distribution by Road Surface** 
   Examines the relationship between road conditions (Dry, Wet, Icy) and the frequency/severity of accidents.  

5.**Relation Between Casualties by Area, Location, and Day/Night**  
   Compares casualty rates across **Urban vs Rural** areas and **Day vs Night**, showing how geography and time influence accident severity.  

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

| **KPI**                       | **Description**                              | **Value**            |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| **Total Casualties**          | Overall number of casualties recorded        | 417,883              |
| **Fatal Casualties**          | Number of deaths caused by road accidents    | 7,135                |
| **Serious Casualties**        | Number of victims severely injured           | 59,312               |
| **Slight Casualties**         | Number of victims slightly injured           | 351,436              |
| **Car Casualties**            | Total number of car-related accidents        | 333,485              |
| **Casualties by Light Condition** | Comparison between daylight and dark conditions | Daylight: 305,000<br>Dark: 112,900 |
| **Casualties by Area**        | Comparison between rural and urban areas     | Rural: 255,900<br>Urban: 162,000   |


## ðŸ“Š Dashboard Features  

- Built using MS Excel  
- Utilized bar charts, doughnut charts, line charts, and maps to visualize data effectively  
- Tree maps: used to highlight the road surface (Wet, Dry or frosty)  
- A filter panel: used to show the nature of the area/location (rural/urban) and also the accident dates.

The visuals were carefully chosen to create a balance between clarity and storytelling â€” helping viewers not just see the data, but understand it.

##  Insights & Recommendations  

- **Cars and Two-Wheelers** recorded the highest casualties, emphasizing the need for better driver education and stricter enforcement of road safety measures.  
- **Single carriageways** showed the most casualties, suggesting design and traffic flow improvements could reduce accident frequency.  
- **Nighttime accidents** tended to be more severe, highlighting the importance of improved road lighting and reflective signage.  
- **Wet surfaces** were consistently linked to higher accident counts, better drainage and warning systems could help prevent these incidents.

## Conclusion

Completing this project was one of those experiences that reminded me how powerful data can be when given meaning.  
It wasnâ€™t just about numbers, it was about understanding human behaviour, road safety, and real-life impact.  

If youâ€™re learning data analysis and feeling unsure or overwhelmed, this is your sign to start anyway.  
Trust me, itâ€™s worth it.
